# EventfulDynmap
Get more events on Dynmap!

## Installation
1. Download the plugin from the [latest release](https://github.com/SimonOrJ/EventfulDynmap/releases/latest).
2. Put it inside your Bukkit/Spigot server's `plugins/` directory.
3. Make sure you have [Dynmap](https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap) running.

Volia, you're done installing the plugin!

## What does this do?
This plugin was written for vanilla server owners who want to broadcast all death messages, /me messages, and /say messages on the dynmap.  The Dynmap plugin doesn't do that on its own.

## How do I configure it?
There is no configuration or commands as of now.  The feature will be added on demand.
